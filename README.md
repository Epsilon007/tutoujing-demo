This code is very simple, just a schematic diagram showing the imaging law of dynamic circular path convex lens in junior high school physics. 
To run this code, you only need to prepare two third-party libraries, numpy and matplotlib.
As an amateur, the code you write is ugly. Don't curse if you don't like it, or curse lightly.
